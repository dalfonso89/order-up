10:40: attempted troubleshooting documented command: go test -v race ./...
	needed to install something for the gcc command to work on windows: cygwin
10:50: began reviewing tasks & project / had agent summarize project for me afterwards
11:05: began working on extending storage layer
	agent assisted with implementing GetOrder / minor adjustments on my part
11:20: began working on the rest of the storage layer functions	
	implemented the others and tested individually with some help from agent for issues
11:30: swapped from sqlite3 to sqlite to avoid cgo issues
11:50: after implementing full storage layer started full test of layer
12:00: began on simple task of expanding errors in api
	agent suggested splitting and classifying errors, but ive simplified
	agent changed messaging of errors, had to change back (was a bit stubborn about this)
12:20: started on Gin middleware refactor on api
	agent had created redundant error handling as middleware already handled these, removed
12:40: ran API to test endpoints work before moving to next task
12:45: began adding new endpoint to cancel an existing order
	agent was caught in a loop testing the cancel endpoint
	implemented refunding
